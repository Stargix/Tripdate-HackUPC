# TripDate
TripDate is a dating demo app developped at HackUPC 2024 to meet people while traveling

# Description
As a team at the Hackathon we developped an app to participate at the TravelPerk challenge.
It consisted on develop something to meet people while traveling, so we designed a date application
inspired by tinder to connect with people that take a flight to the same place.

# Dataset
The dataset provided to us by TravelPerk consisted in thousends of users with their city, 
flight destination, and the dates.

# Options
- User creation
- Recommendation Section
- Matching Section
- Chat
- Profile (demo)

# Backend
The recommendation Section works with a Chat-GPT API that returns in json places to visit on the visited place.
This iconic places of the visited city are used by another API to get images of the site, so we can get
an idea as users of how do they look like. Moreover, thanks to the json returned by Chat-GPT, we were
able to include a orientative price of the experience and a description.
